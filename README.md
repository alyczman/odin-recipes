# odin-recipes

This project is my first attempt at a web development through the Odin Project. The initial assignment was to create a basic website to host different recipes that help enforce the skills of lists, links, and doctype notation. The three recipes are great compliaments to each other:

1. Chicken Noodle Soup (my personal recipe)
2. Grilled Cheese
3. Salad
