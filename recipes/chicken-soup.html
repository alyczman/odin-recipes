    <h2>The Best Soup for your Soul</h2>

    <p>Chicken noodle soup has been been one of my favorite meals since I was a little kid. Whether you're just coming
        in from a day of playing outside in the snow or just having an off day, this is a meal guaranteed to pick up 
        your spirits. It can be as complex or simple as you want or need - the key, however, is to use fresh ingredients to 
        ensure you're getting its full benefits.
